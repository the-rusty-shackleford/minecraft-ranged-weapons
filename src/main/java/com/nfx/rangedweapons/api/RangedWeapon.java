 * A ranged weapon in the hands of any living entity.

 * a bridge on its behalf) implements. Nothing here takes a {@code Player}:
 * every gun mod's own API is player-bound, which is exactly why a mob cannot
 * use one directly. And nothing here reads the shooter's look angle -- aim is
 * always the explicit vector in the {@link Shot}, because on a mob the look
 * angle is body yaw and lags the head while strafing.
 *
 * <p>An implementation is stateless and shared: all per-stack state lives in
 * the stack's data components, read and written through {@link AmmoStore}.
