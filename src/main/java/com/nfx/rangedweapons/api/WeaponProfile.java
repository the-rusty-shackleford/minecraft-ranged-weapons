/**
 * What is true of every stack of one weapon item: its class, its default
 * stats, what it eats, and what it sounds like. Immutable.
 *
 * <p>Items and sounds are referenced by id and resolved at use rather than
 * held as registry objects, so a profile can be built -- and, later, decoded
 * from a datapack -- without a bootstrapped registry. An id that resolves to
 * nothing degrades: no ammo drops, no sound plays.
 *
 * <p>RI: no field is null. Enforced in the constructor; the {@code Optional}s
 * express absence, a null {@code Optional} is a bug.
 *
 * @param weaponClass  the coarse category, for consumer policy
 * @param defaults     the stats for a stack with no overrides of its own
 * @param ammoItem     the loose-round item this weapon eats, if any; what a killed carrier drops
 * @param magazineItem a detachable container for its rounds, if any; also loot
 * @param shotSound    the report heard near the shooter, if any
 * @param farShotSound the muffled report heard at a distance, if any
