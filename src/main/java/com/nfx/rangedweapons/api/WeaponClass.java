/**
 * A coarse category of ranged weapon: sidearm, rifle, shotgun, automatic.
 *
 * <p>Consumers use it for <em>policy</em> -- "never issue automatics to a mob"
 * -- and the protocol itself never reads it. It is an open set: any mod may
 * mint a class by name, instances are interned so identity comparison is
 * valid, and a consumer that meets a name it does not know treats it as
 * opaque rather than as an error. The same shape as NeoForge's own
 * {@code ItemAbility}, for the same reason: a Java enum cannot be extended
 * and a registry would freeze the set at load.
 *
 * <p>Immutable. RI: {@code name} matches {@code [a-z0-9_]+}, and at most one
 * instance exists per name (interned through {@code BY_NAME}).
